As usual,&lt;br /&gt; Red Hat sent three representatives, &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/09/03/report-from-july-2019-iso-c-meeting-core-language/"&gt;Jason Merrill in the Core Working Group (CWG)&lt;/a&gt;, Jonathan Wakely in the Library Working Group (LWG), and myself in the Concurrency and Parallelism Study Group (SG1). This rather late report covers the Cologne SG1 session and looks ahead to some revised papers from that meeting, which are scheduled for the fall meeting in Belfast, Northern Ireland, for the first week of November 2019.&lt;span id="more-648547"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;C++20 Synchronization Library&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Monday started as usual after the main plenary session. SG1 started the week by reviewing some non-controversial&lt;br /&gt; additions to C++20 synchronization primitives. The first of these papers was &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1633R0"&gt;p1633R0&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Amendments to the C++20&lt;br /&gt; Synchronization Library,&amp;#8221; which dealt some minor issues discovered during wording review of the C++20&lt;br /&gt; Synchronization Library (&lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1135R4"&gt;p1135R4)&lt;/a&gt;. The changes were applied to R5 of the paper, and SG1 voted to forward &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1135R5"&gt;p1135R5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; to LWG. Next up were &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1643R0"&gt;p1643R0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1644R0"&gt;p1644R0&lt;/a&gt;, which propose to add wait/notify functionality to atomic_ref and&lt;br /&gt; atomic, respectively. SG1 voted to forward both of these papers to the Library Evolution Working Group (LEWG).&lt;br /&gt; The final paper before lunch was &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p0943R2"&gt;p0943R2&lt;/a&gt;, which concerns supporting C atomics in C++. SG1 voted to let the paper&lt;br /&gt; proceed without needing to return for further review.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the break, SG1 took up the subject of stackful co-routines (aka &amp;#8220;fibers&amp;#8221;) with two papers:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1520R0"&gt;P1520&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Response to response to &amp;#8220;Fibers under the magnifying glass.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8221; This paper seeks to clarify some aspects of the distinction between stackless co-routines and stackful fibers.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p0876R5"&gt;P0876&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;fiber_context &amp;#8211; fibers without scheduler.&amp;#8221; This is the latest (R6) paper in the series of proposals to bring fibers to the C++ standard. SG1 consensus was that P0876 needs changes to proceed. Further discussion on Friday reached agreement to target a Technical Specification as a ship vehicle for the proposal with the requested changes applied.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Executors&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, it was on to everyone&amp;#8217;s favorite topic: Executors. The first paper &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1525R0"&gt;P1525&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;One-Way execute is a Poor Basis Operation.&amp;#8221; This paper argues in favor of the previous proposal for Executor Sender/Receiver as described in &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1341r0"&gt;P1341&lt;/a&gt; as the basis operation(s) supported by Executors, with other operations built in terms of senders and receivers, as opposed to &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p0443"&gt;P0443&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s OneWayExecutor concept. The SG1 presentation and subsequent discussion were primarily to inform Tuesday&amp;#8217;s discussions on &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p0443"&gt;p0443&lt;/a&gt;. The last paper of the day was &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1738"&gt;P1738 &lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;The Executor Concept Hierarchy Needs a Single Root.&amp;#8221; This paper seeks to argue that, because P0443&amp;#8217;s Executor concepts and mechanism for adding new concepts don&amp;#8217;t form a subsumption hierarchy, it&amp;#8217;s difficult to design generic components that accept executors. As with &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1525"&gt;P1525&lt;/a&gt;, this was an informational presentation to inform Tuesday&amp;#8217;s discussions on &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p0443"&gt;P0443&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning, SG1 kicked off by reviewing &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1068"&gt;P1068&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Vector API for random number generation.&amp;#8221; This paper&lt;br /&gt; proposes to add SIMD support for random number generation. The discussion led to weak consensus that such a facility should produce a SIMD type as described in &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/n4796"&gt;N4796&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Technical Specification for C++ Extensions for Parallelism.&amp;#8221; A revision of this paper will likely be discussed at the fall WG21 meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next up was &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1367"&gt;P1367&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Not All Agents Have TLS.&amp;#8221; This paper proposes standardizing the existing practice of thread_local, as the reality of TLS usage is much more complicated than the wording in the Standard even allows us to explain. This is a rather complicated topic and SG1 had an extensive discussion on the issues, but no straw polls were taken at this meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tuesday afternoon, SG1 resumed discussion on Executors with &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1658"&gt;P1658&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Suggestions for Consensus on Executors.&amp;#8221; This paper proposes to modify the executors model as described by &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p0443"&gt;P0443&lt;/a&gt; to increase consensus in the hope that executors are merged with C++23 as planned. The compromise seeks to essentially create a singly rooted executor concept hierarchy and add support for customization of bulk_execute as well as introducing the Sender/Receiver concepts. The main point of contention remaining from the compromise is error handling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We then discussed &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1791"&gt;P1791&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Evolution of the &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p0443"&gt;P0443&lt;/a&gt; Unified Executors Proposal to accommodate new requirements.&amp;#8221; The central premise of this paper is the properties mechanism outlined in &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p0443"&gt;P0443&lt;/a&gt; can support the requirements of &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1660"&gt;P1660&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s sender/receiver model. Again, significant discussion time was spent on what sort of error channel(s) should be supported. Next, &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1792"&gt;P1792&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Simplifying and generalising Sender/Receiver for asynchronous operations&amp;#8221; argues that the API design approach of &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1341"&gt;P1341&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Unifying Asynchronous APIs in C++ Standard Library&amp;#8221; presents problems with usability, flexibility, and efficiency compared to existing practice. No straw polls were taken; significant differences of opinion remain. The last paper of the day was &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1660"&gt;P1660&lt;/a&gt;. After extensive discussion, SG1 voted to apply &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1658"&gt;P1658&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s proposed changes to &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p0443"&gt;P0443&lt;/a&gt;, and that it would be &amp;#8220;tolerable'&amp;#8221; to ship error handling as in P1660. There was no consensus to proceed with error&lt;br /&gt; handling as in &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1791"&gt;P1791&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Memory model topics&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wednesday, SG1 turned its attention to all things memory model, starting with an update on &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1217"&gt;P1217 &lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;Out-of-thin-air, revisited, again.&amp;#8221; Next up, &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1780"&gt;P1780&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Modular Relaxed Dependencies: A new approach to the Out-Of-Thin-Air Problem.&amp;#8221; Next, SG1 reviewed &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1478"&gt;P1478R0&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Byte-wise atomic memcpy,&amp;#8221; which was presented as a draft at the Spring 2019 meeting and essentially looks to codify what most memcpy implementations already do. The shipping vehicle is likely a Technical Specification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wednesday afternoon, SG1 reviewed &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1116"&gt;P1116&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Re-Gaining Exclusive Ownership from shared_ptrs,&amp;#8221; which is a proposal to add a &amp;#8220;lock_exclusive()&amp;#8221; operation to shared_ptr. SG1 determined it is implementable but not without ABI breakage, and they don&amp;#8217;t like the name of the operation. Next up, we reviewed &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1726"&gt;P1726&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Pointer lifetime-end zap.&amp;#8221; This paper seeks to reconcile what the Standard says about the state of pointer after an object&amp;#8217;s lifetime has ended, with well-known algorithms that rely on being able to perform certain operations on pointers whose lifetimes have ended. There are various suggestions to address this issue, but no conclusions were reached at this meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, we looked at &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p0940"&gt;P0940&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Concurrency TS is growing: Concurrent Utilities and Data Structures&amp;#8221; and &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1445"&gt;P1445&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Concurrency TS: to update or not update.&amp;#8221; The discussion of these papers mostly had to do with timing of issuing a new Technical Specification and what language standard it should be based on. From here, the discussion moved on to &amp;#8220;Clarifying atomic&amp;#60;thread::id&amp;#62;::compare_exchange_*&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1801"&gt;P1801&lt;/a&gt;). SG1 voted to approve the proposed resolution presented in the paper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Low-level I/O and more executors&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thursday morning, SG1 considered a pair of related papers that deal with supporting low-level IO facilities and the ability to detach objects, transport them elsewhere, and resume the object lifetime. The papers were &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1031"&gt;P1031&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Low-level file i/o library&amp;#8221; and &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1631"&gt;P1631&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Object detachment and attachment.&amp;#8221; The scope of these papers is quite large, even to just survey the issues, and SG1 determined that these proposals fall squarely in SG1&amp;#8217;s remit. Next SG1 considered&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p0652"&gt;P0652&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Concurrent associative data structure with unsynchronized view,&amp;#8221; which had been updated based on SG1&amp;#8217;s guidance at the Spring 2019 meeting. SG1 discussed the various issues with such a datatype, but no straw polls were taken. Next SG1 looked at &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1761"&gt;P1761&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Concurrent map customization options.&amp;#8221; These concurrent data structure papers are likely headed to a Technical Specification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Thursday afternoon, SG1 reviewed a handful of executor-related papers, starting with &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1019"&gt;P1019&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Integrating Executors with Parallel Algorithms.&amp;#8221; Next was &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p0797r2"&gt;P0797R2&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Handling Concurrent Exceptions with Executors,&amp;#8221; followed by &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1436"&gt;P1436R0&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Executor properties for affinity-based execution.&amp;#8221; There was general agreement that executors should support some form of error handling facility, as not all agents support C++ exceptions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Friday papers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;SG1 started Friday morning looking at &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1382"&gt;P1382&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;volatile_load&amp;#60;T&amp;#62; and volatile_store&amp;#60;T&amp;#62;,&amp;#8221; which is related to &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1152"&gt;P1152&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Deprecating volatile.&amp;#8221; Next up was &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1750"&gt;P1750&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;A Proposal to Add Process Management to the C++ Standard Library.&amp;#8221; The proposal is based on the boost.process library, which provides cross-platform process management functionality, with a lot of discussion about how to support this within the standard. A new version of &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1750"&gt;P1750&lt;/a&gt; is available in the pre-Belfast meeting and is likely to be on SG1&amp;#8217;s agenda again. The last paper of the morning was &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1108"&gt;P1108&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;web_view,&amp;#8221; which proposes a web_view facility for the C++ standard library that leverages existing web standards and technology. A new version of &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1108"&gt;P1108&lt;/a&gt; is in the pre-Belfast mailing and is likely to be on SG1&amp;#8217;s agenda again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friday afternoon, SG1 reviewed &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p1795"&gt;P1795&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;System topology discovery for heterogeneous and distributed computing.&amp;#8221; A new revision of this paper is available in the pre-Belfast meeting and is likely to be on SG1&amp;#8217;s agenda again. The last paper SG1 discussed in Cologne was &lt;a href="https://wg21.link/p0642"&gt;P0642&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;The Concurrent Invocation Library.&amp;#8221; The aim of this paper is to provide structural support for invoking multiple operations concurrently in C++.

With a four-week release schedule, Liberty usually has the latest MicroProfile release available soon after the spec is published.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, Open Liberty is supported in common developer tools, including VS Code, Eclipse, Maven, and Gradle. Server configuration (e.g., adding or removing a capability, or &amp;#8220;feature,&amp;#8221; to your app) is through an XML file. Open Liberty’s zero migration policy means that you can focus on what’s important (writing your app!) and not have to worry about APIs changing under you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Deploy in containers to any cloud&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you’re ready to deploy your app, you can just containerize it and deploy it to OpenShift. The zero migration principle means that new versions of Open Liberty features will not break your app, and you can control which version of the feature your app uses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Monitoring live microservices is enabled by MicroProfile &lt;a href="https://www.openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-metrics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Metrics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-microprofile-health.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-opentracing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;OpenTracing&lt;/a&gt;, which add observability to your apps. The emitted metrics from your apps and from the Open Liberty runtime can be consolidated using Prometheus and presented in Grafana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Learn with the Open Liberty developer guides&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.openliberty.io/guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Open Liberty developer guides&lt;/a&gt; are available with runnable code and explanations to help you learn how to write microservices with &lt;a href="https://openliberty.io/guides/?search=microprofile&amp;#38;key=tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;MicroProfile&lt;/a&gt;

You can wait to monitor for performance issues once you launch the application on your test or staging servers, or in production if you’re feeling lucky, but why not track performance as you develop? This allows you to identify improvement opportunities before rolling out changes to a test or production environment. This article demonstrates how two tools can work together to integrate performance monitoring into your development environment: &lt;a href="https://www.eclipse.org/che/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Eclipse Che&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Jaeger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Eclipse Che website:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Che brings your Kubernetes application into your development environment and provides an in-browser IDE, allowing you to code, build, test, and run applications exactly as they run on production from any machine.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this article, we show how simple it is to add Jaeger to your Eclipse Che development workspace and observe how your Kubernetes application performs. We will use &lt;a href="http://che.openshift.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;che.openshift.io&lt;/a&gt; as the hosting environment, although you could &lt;a href="https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/running-che-locally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;set up a local Che server&lt;/a&gt; if you prefer.&lt;span id="more-648657"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="create-the-workspace"&gt;Create the workspace&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Che 7 introduced the capability to define a development workspace in a YAML format called a &lt;a href="https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/configuring-a-workspace-using-a-devfile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;devfile&lt;/a&gt;. Example devfiles can be found in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/redhat-developer/devfile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Red Hat Developers GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For this post, we use a modified version of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/redhat-developer/devfile/blob/master/getting-started/spring-boot/devfile.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Spring Boot getting started devfile&lt;/a&gt;, which adds the Jaeger all-in-one backend to the workspace. The main change is to add the following section just before the &lt;code&gt;commands&lt;/code&gt; top-level node:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- type: dockerimage alias: tracing image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest env: - name: MEMORY_MAX_TRACES value: "5000" - name: COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT value: "9411" memoryLimit: 128Mi endpoints: - name: 'tracing-ui' port: 16686 - name: 'collector-grpc' port: 14250 attributes: public: 'false' - name: 'collector-http' port: 14268 attributes: public: 'false' - name: 'collector-zipkin' port: 9411 attributes: public: 'false' - name: 'agent-config' port: 5778 attributes: public: 'false' - name: '6831/udp' port: 6831 attributes: public: 'false' - name: '6832/udp' port: 6832 attributes: public: 'false' volumes: - name: tmp containerPath: /tmp &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fully modified version of the devfile can be found &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/objectiser/667615926a40d6cd8eb675859ddee1a1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with the additional memory limit changes required for using &lt;a href="http://che.openshift.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;che.openshift.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To start the workspace on &lt;a href="http://che.openshift.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;che.openshift.io&lt;/a&gt;, point a browser to &lt;a href="http://che.openshift.io/f?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/objectiser/667615926a40d6cd8eb675859ddee1a1/raw/06d25e2026d7a689dd8b38a343eec9a9cc431cde/che-spring-boot-devfile.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;this url&lt;/a&gt;.

It also bootstraps the Jaeger tracer to report the tracing data to the Jaeger back end (included in the workspace). The default tracer configuration will report the data via UDP to the Jaeger agent, although the application can be configured to report the data via &lt;a href="https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-spring-jaeger#configuration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;HTTP directly to the collector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The final step is to add a property that defines the service name within the tracing data. This goal is achieved by creating the &lt;code&gt;src/main/resources&lt;/code&gt; folder and then creating the file &lt;code&gt;application.properties&lt;/code&gt; with the contents shown in Figure 3:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_648897" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-648897" class="wp-image-648897" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/jaeger-che3-300x147.png" alt="" width="600" height="295" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/jaeger-che3-300x147.png 300w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/jaeger-che3-768x378.png 768w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/jaeger-che3.png 895w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-648897" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Figure 3: Defining the service name within the tracing data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2 id="trace-the-running-application"&gt;Trace the running application&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the right side of the workspace is a cube symbol.

&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This article has shown how OpenTracing with Jaeger can easily be introduced into an Eclipse Che workspace so you can obtain tracing information from applications during development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This particular example is simple and only captures tracing from a single service. The benefit offered by Che is enabling complete applications (multiple services) to be used within the same workspace, thus producing more interesting traces and helping developers understand the performance of their developed service in the context of the complete application.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Ftracing-kubernetes-applications-with-jaeger-and-eclipse-che%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Tracing%20Kubernetes%20applications%20with%20Jaeger%20and%20Eclipse%20Che" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Ftracing-kubernetes-applications-with-jaeger-and-eclipse-che%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Tracing%20Kubernetes%20applications%20with%20Jaeger%20and%20Eclipse%20Che" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Ftracing-kubernetes-applications-with-jaeger-and-eclipse-che%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Tracing%20Kubernetes%20applications%20with%20Jaeger%20and%20Eclipse%20Che" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_email" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Ftracing-kubernetes-applications-with-jaeger-and-eclipse-che%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Tracing%20Kubernetes%20applications%20with%20Jaeger%20and%20Eclipse%20Che" title="Email" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_print" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/print?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Ftracing-kubernetes-applications-with-jaeger-and-eclipse-che%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Tracing%20Kubernetes%20applications%20with%20Jaeger%20and%20Eclipse%20Che" title="Print" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Ftracing-kubernetes-applications-with-jaeger-and-eclipse-che%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Tracing%20Kubernetes%20applications%20with%20Jaeger%20and%20Eclipse%20Che" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_flipboard" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/flipboard?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Ftracing-kubernetes-applications-with-jaeger-and-eclipse-che%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Tracing%20Kubernetes%20applications%20with%20Jaeger%20and%20Eclipse%20Che" title="Flipboard" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Ftracing-kubernetes-applications-with-jaeger-and-eclipse-che%2F&amp;#038;title=Tracing%20Kubernetes%20applications%20with%20Jaeger%20and%20Eclipse%20Che" data-a2a-url="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/11/14/tracing-kubernetes-applications-with-jaeger-and-eclipse-che/" data-a2a-title="Tracing Kubernetes applications with Jaeger and Eclipse Che"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.addtoany.com/buttons/favicon.png" alt="Share"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/11/14/tracing-kubernetes-applications-with-jaeger-and-eclipse-che/"&gt;Tracing Kubernetes applications with Jaeger and Eclipse Che&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog"&gt;Red Hat Developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/jbossbuzz/~4/9rwysMdWORY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><summary>Developing distributed applications is complicated.

When understanding how the Pod Lifecycle Event Generator (PLEG) works, it is helpful to also understand troubleshooting around this issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is PLEG?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The PLEG module in kubelet (Kubernetes) adjusts the container runtime state with each matched pod-level event and keeps the pod cache up to date by applying changes.&lt;span id="more-645967"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s take a look at the dotted red line below in the process image.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-645557" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/orig-pleg-1.png" alt="" width="761" height="437" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/orig-pleg-1.png 761w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/orig-pleg-1-300x172.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The original image is here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/node/pod-lifecycle-event-generator.md"&gt;Kubelet: Pod Lifecycle Event Generator (PLEG)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How does &amp;#8220;PLEG is not healthy&amp;#8221; happen?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kubelet keeps checking PLEG health by calling &lt;code&gt;Healthy()&lt;/code&gt; periodically in &lt;code&gt;SyncLoop()&lt;/code&gt; as follows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Healthy()&lt;/code&gt; checks whether the &lt;code&gt;relist&lt;/code&gt; process (the PLEG key task) completes within 3 minutes. This function is added to &lt;code&gt;runtimeState&lt;/code&gt; as &amp;#8220;PLEG&amp;#8221; and is called periodically from &amp;#8220;SyncLoop&amp;#8221;(every 10s by default). If the &amp;#8220;relist&amp;#8221; process take more than 3 minutes, a &amp;#8220;PLEG is not healthy&amp;#8221; issue is reported through this stack process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll walk you through the related source code based on Kubernetes 1.11 (OpenShift 3.11) in each part to help your understanding.

They had run into an issue where Elasticsearch would throw an error similar to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] likely too low, increase to at least [262144]&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the official documentation, &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/index.html"&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt; uses a &lt;code&gt;mmapfs&lt;/code&gt; directory by default to store its indices. The default operating system limits on mmap counts are likely to be too low, which may result in out of memory exceptions. Usually, administrators would just increase the limits by running:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, OpenShift uses &lt;a href="https://www.openshift.com/learn/coreos/"&gt;Red Hat CoreOS&lt;/a&gt; for its worker nodes and, because it is an automatically updating, minimal operating system for running containerized workloads, you shouldn&amp;#8217;t manually log on to worker nodes and make changes. This approach is unscalable and results in a worker node becoming tainted. Instead, OpenShift provides an elegant and scalable method to achieve the same via its &lt;a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/nodes/nodes/nodes-node-tuning-operator.html"&gt;Node Tuning Operator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span id="more-645287"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The default tuned configuration contains a profile for Elasticsearch. The tuned operator on a given node looks for a pod running on the same node with the tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch label set (match). If found, it applies the &lt;code&gt;sysctl&lt;/code&gt; command (data).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can view the default configuration by logging into your OpenShift cluster and running:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;bastion $ oc get Tuned/default -o yaml -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator apiVersion: tuned.openshift.io/v1alpha1 kind: Tuned metadata: name: default namespace: openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator spec: profile: ... ... - name: "openshift-node-es" data: | [main] summary=Optimize systems running ES on OpenShift nodes include=openshift-node [sysctl] vm.max_map_count=262144 recommend: ... ... - profile: "openshift-node-es" priority: 20 match: - label: "tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch" type: "pod" ``` &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trick is to ensure that the Elasticsearch operator tags its pods with the label: &lt;code&gt;tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch&lt;/code&gt;. Below is an example of how to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;--- apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1alpha1 kind: Elasticsearch metadata: name: elasticsearch-tst spec: version: "7.2.0" setVmMaxMapCount: false nodes: - config: node.master: true node.data: true nodeCount: 1 podTemplate: metadata: labels: tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch: "" &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tuned operator will read the pod label &lt;code&gt;tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch&lt;/code&gt; and add the &lt;code&gt;vm.max_map_count=262144&lt;/code&gt; to the node running the pod. This is useful because pods can be terminated and scheduled on different nodes across the cluster. No more manually worrying about the sysctl configuration of the nodes running a particular workload.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to James Ryles for helping solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me know if you run into any issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F12%2Fusing-the-red-hat-openshift-tuned-operator-for-elasticsearch%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Using%20the%20Red%20Hat%20OpenShift%20tuned%20Operator%20for%20Elasticsearch" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F12%2Fusing-the-red-hat-openshift-tuned-operator-for-elasticsearch%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Using%20the%20Red%20Hat%20OpenShift%20tuned%20Operator%20for%20Elasticsearch" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F12%2Fusing-the-red-hat-openshift-tuned-operator-for-elasticsearch%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Using%20the%20Red%20Hat%20OpenShift%20tuned%20Operator%20for%20Elasticsearch" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_email" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F12%2Fusing-the-red-hat-openshift-tuned-operator-for-elasticsearch%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Using%20the%20Red%20Hat%20OpenShift%20tuned%20Operator%20for%20Elasticsearch" title="Email" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_print" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/print?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F12%2Fusing-the-red-hat-openshift-tuned-operator-for-elasticsearch%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Using%20the%20Red%20Hat%20OpenShift%20tuned%20Operator%20for%20Elasticsearch" title="Print" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F12%2Fusing-the-red-hat-openshift-tuned-operator-for-elasticsearch%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Using%20the%20Red%20Hat%20OpenShift%20tuned%20Operator%20for%20Elasticsearch" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_flipboard" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/flipboard?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F12%2Fusing-the-red-hat-openshift-tuned-operator-for-elasticsearch%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Using%20the%20Red%20Hat%20OpenShift%20tuned%20Operator%20for%20Elasticsearch" title="Flipboard" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F11%2F12%2Fusing-the-red-hat-openshift-tuned-operator-for-elasticsearch%2F&amp;#038;title=Using%20the%20Red%20Hat%20OpenShift%20tuned%20Operator%20for%20Elasticsearch" data-a2a-url="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/11/12/using-the-red-hat-openshift-tuned-operator-for-elasticsearch/" data-a2a-title="Using the Red Hat OpenShift tuned Operator for Elasticsearch"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.addtoany.com/buttons/favicon.png" alt="Share"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/11/12/using-the-red-hat-openshift-tuned-operator-for-elasticsearch/"&gt;Using the Red Hat OpenShift tuned Operator for Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog"&gt;Red Hat Developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/jbossbuzz/~4/Hjf_SUgMV70" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><summary>I recently assisted a client to deploy Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) on Red Hat OpenShift 4.x.

The result is a Spring Boot-based application that uses the Apache Camel component &lt;a href="https://camel.apache.org/components/2.x/twitter-search-component.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;code&gt;twitter-search&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that searches Twitter for tweets based on specific keywords. If traffic or the number of tweets increases, and this application cannot serve all requests, then the application autoscales itself by increasing the number of pods. The ability to serve all requests is monitored by tracking this application&amp;#8217;s CPU utilization on a particular pod. Also, as soon as traffic or CPU utilization is back to normal, the number of pods is reduced to the minimum configured value.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are two types of scaling: &lt;em&gt;horizontal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;vertical&lt;/em&gt;. Horizontal scaling is where the number of application instances or containers is increased. Vertical scaling is where system resources like CPU and memory are increased at the running application&amp;#8217;s or container&amp;#8217;s runtime. Horizontal scaling can be used for &lt;em&gt;stateless&lt;/em&gt; applications, whereas vertical scaling is more suitable for &lt;em&gt;stateful&lt;/em&gt; applications.&lt;span id="more-644747"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Autoscaling is useful when applications are deployed in a cloud environment from any of the cloud vendors, where users have to pay for resources like CPU and memory. It may happen that traffic is heavier on weekends or particular weekdays, or even for a few hours on a specific day, so having a static setup might cost more and not fully utilize system resources. Having a dynamic environment where applications can scale themselves reduces overall cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; For demonstration and proof-of-concept purposes, we are using Red Hat OpenShift 3.11 and Red Hat Fuse 7.4. Our aim is to display one of the OpenShift features (autoscaling), which is not available with traditional applications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Follow the instructions in the official &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_fuse/7.4/html/fuse_on_openshift_guide/get-started-admin#configure-container-registry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Red Hat Fuse documentation&lt;/a&gt; to set up Red Hat Fuse 7.4 on OpenShift. OpenShift should automatically increase or decrease the scale of a replication controller, or deployment configuration, based on metrics collected from the pods. To collect these CPU and memory metrics from your pods, the &lt;code&gt;metrics&lt;/code&gt; server has to be installed on your OpenShift server to capture CPU and memory metrics from pods. Check out the &lt;a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Pod Autoscaling guide&lt;/a&gt; for how to do this using Ansible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Create the application&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The code for this demonstration is available in &lt;a href="https://github.com/1984shekhar/camel-twitter-shift" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;my personal GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. Start by deploying this code to your OpenShift environment using the source-to-image (S2I) approach. First, select an application template from the OpenShift catalog. I selected Red Hat Fuse 7.4 Camel with Spring Boot, shown in Figure 1:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_644947" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-644947" class="wp-image-644947 size-large" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6_Catalog_Fuse-1024x447.png" alt="The OpenShift catalog with an application template selected." width="640" height="279" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6_Catalog_Fuse-1024x447.png 1024w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6_Catalog_Fuse-300x131.png 300w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6_Catalog_Fuse-768x335.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-644947" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1: The OpenShift catalog with an application template selected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, point the Git Repository URL to the GitHub repository&amp;#8217;s link. In our case, this &lt;code&gt;camel-twitter-shift&lt;/code&gt; component searches tweets with the keywords &lt;code&gt;imcdemo,&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;RED_HAT_APAC&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;RedHatTelco&lt;/code&gt;. This component will poll Twitter for two minutes, which is configured with the &lt;code&gt;delay&lt;/code&gt; property and other properties that are user-specific.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, point Git Reference to the branch containing the actual code. I set it to &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;, as you can see in Figure 2:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_644957" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-644957" class="wp-image-644957 size-large" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/7_s2i_github_hook-1024x471.png" alt="Configuring the selected application template." width="640" height="294" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/7_s2i_github_hook-1024x471.png 1024w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/7_s2i_github_hook-300x138.png 300w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/7_s2i_github_hook-768x353.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-644957" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: Configuring the selected application template.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;To get your &lt;code&gt;consumerKey&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;consumerSecret&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;accessToken&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;accessTokenSecret,&lt;/code&gt; register for the Standard API (which is free, though there are limitations) through the &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Twitter developer platform&lt;/a&gt;. After consuming tweets for keywords, we then log them to the console with the Camel log component:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&amp;#60;route id="twitter-search"&amp;#62; &amp;#60;from id="route-search" uri="twitter-search://imcdemo OR RED_HAT_APAC OR RedHatTelco?type=polling&amp;#38;amp;delay=120000&amp;#38;amp;consumerKey=dF&amp;#38;amp;consumerSecret=Ay&amp;#38;amp;accessToken=7d&amp;#38;amp;accessTokenSecret=9K"/&amp;#62; &amp;#60;log id="route-log-search" message="&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; ${body}"/&amp;#62; &amp;#60;/route&amp;#62; &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Set up horizontal autoscaling&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We can set autoscaling for the &lt;code&gt;fuse74-camel-twitter&lt;/code&gt; deployment config with the following command. Note that &lt;code&gt;cpu-percent&lt;/code&gt; is set to 10, which means that as soon as CPU utilization is more than 10% for the pod, the application will scale new pods, with the maximum number of pods being five:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;cpandey@cpandey camel-twitter-shift]$ oc autoscale dc/fuse74-camel-twitter --min 1 --max 5 --cpu-percent=10 horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/fuse74-camel-twitter autoscaled &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Figure 3, the first red arrow points to the minimum and the maximum number of configured pods. The second arrow is the route with which we can access a pod from an external HTTP-based service or application.

This container listens on port 9956:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&amp;#60;route id="load-route"&amp;#62; &amp;#60;from id="_from1" uri="undertow:http://0.0.0.0:9956/undertowTest"/&amp;#62; &amp;#60;convertBodyTo id="_convertBodyTo1" type="java.lang.String"/&amp;#62; &amp;#60;log id="_log1" loggingLevel="INFO" message="\n REQUEST RECEIVED :\n Headers: ${headers}\n Body: ${body} \n"/&amp;#62; &amp;#60;setBody id="_setBody1"&amp;#62; &amp;#60;constant&amp;#62;hello all&amp;#60;/constant&amp;#62; &amp;#60;/setBody&amp;#62; &amp;#60;/route&amp;#62;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the &lt;code&gt;loop.sh&lt;/code&gt; script, we can send requests to this route in bulk.

In this article, I&amp;#8217;ll cover the highlights of the new releases and show how to get started.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-649017"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="installation"&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/overview"&gt;Red Hat CodeReady Studio&lt;/a&gt; (previously known as Red Hat Developer Studio) comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply download it from our &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/overview"&gt;Red Hat CodeReady Studio product page&lt;/a&gt; and run it like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;java -jar codereadystudio-&amp;#60;installername&amp;#62;.jar&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;JBoss Tools or Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) CodeReady Studio requires a bit more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This release requires at least Eclipse 4.13 (2019-09), but we recommend using the latest &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-09/r/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers"&gt;Eclipse 4.13 2019-09 JEE Bundle&lt;/a&gt; because then you get most of the dependencies pre-installed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you have installed Eclipse, you can either find us on the Eclipse Marketplace under &amp;#8220;JBoss Tools&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Red Hat CodeReady Studio.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For JBoss Tools, you can also use our update site directly:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/photon/stable/updates/&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h2 id="what-is-new"&gt;What&amp;#8217;s new?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our main focus for this release was improvements for container-based development and bug fixing. Eclipse 2019-06 itself has a lot of new cool stuff, but I&amp;#8217;ll highlight just a few updates in both Eclipse 2019-06 and JBoss Tools plugins that I think are worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="openshift"&gt;Red Hat OpenShift&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id="openshift-container-platform-4-2-support"&gt;OpenShift Container Platform 4.2 support&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the new &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/10/16/developer-tools-openshift/"&gt;OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.2&lt;/a&gt; now available (see the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-expands-kubernetes-developer-experience-newest-version-red-hat-openshift-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;), even if this is a major shift compared to OCP 3, Red Hat CodeReady Studio and JBoss Tools are compatible with this major release in a transparent way. Just define your connection to your OCP 4.2 based cluster as you did before for an OCP 3 cluster, and use the tooling!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id="codeready-containers-1-0-server-adapter"&gt;CodeReady Containers 1.0 Server Adapter&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new server adapter has been added to support the next generation of CodeReady Containers 1.0. Although the server adapter itself has limited functionality, it is able to start and stop the CodeReady Containers virtual machine via its crc binary. Simply hit Ctrl+3 (Cmd+3 on OSX) and type &lt;code&gt;new server&lt;/code&gt;, which will bring up a command to set up a new server.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter" src="https://tools.stage.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/crc-server-adapter.png" alt="crc server adapter" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;code&gt;crc&lt;/code&gt; in the filter textbox.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You should see the &lt;em&gt;Red Hat CodeReady Containers 1.0&lt;/em&gt; server adapter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="pdBgHkl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc28750dea1a.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-649037 " data-add-featherlight="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc28750dea1a.png" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc28750dea1a.png" alt="" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc28750dea1a.png 601w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc28750dea1a-286x300.png 286w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Select &lt;em&gt;Red Hat CodeReady Containers 1.0&lt;/em&gt; and click &lt;em&gt;Next&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CXRwfPn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc2877a15c37.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-649047 " data-add-featherlight="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc2877a15c37.png" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc2877a15c37.png" alt="" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc2877a15c37.png 609w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc2877a15c37-290x300.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All you have to do is set the location of the CodeReady Containers crc binary file and the pull secret file location, which can be downloaded from &lt;a class="bare" href="https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned"&gt;https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="vmqfgiq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc28799cc391.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-649057 " data-add-featherlight="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc28799cc391.png" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc28799cc391.png" alt="" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc28799cc391.png 603w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc28799cc391-288x300.png 288w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you’re finished, a new CodeReady Containers server adapter will then be created and visible in the Servers view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="qBXUONu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc287b585d64.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-649067 " data-add-featherlight="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc287b585d64.png" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc287b585d64.png" alt="" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc287b585d64.png 993w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc287b585d64-300x79.png 300w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc287b585d64-768x203.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 993px) 100vw, 993px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Once the server is started, a new OpenShift connection should appear in the &lt;em&gt;OpenShift Explorer&lt;/em&gt; view, allowing the user to quickly create a new Openshift application and begin developing their AwesomeApp in a highly replicatable environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="miwdVPP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc287e49749c.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-649077 " data-add-featherlight="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc287e49749c.png" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc287e49749c.png" alt="" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc287e49749c.png 995w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc287e49749c-300x79.png 300w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc287e49749c-768x203.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 995px) 100vw, 995px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Server tools&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id="wildfly-18-server-adapter"&gt;Wildfly 18 Server Adapter&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;A server adapter has been added to work with Wildfly 18.

The dialog provides a quick overview showing matching lines of text at a glance. It updates as quickly as you can type and allows for quick navigation using only the keyboard. A typical workflow starts by pressing the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+Shift+L (or Cmd+Alt+Shift+L on Mac). Typing a few letters updates the search result as you type. Use Up-Down arrow keys to select a match, then hit Enter to open it in an editor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="pHSOHma"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc288852cfb9.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-649087 " data-add-featherlight="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc288852cfb9.png" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc288852cfb9.png" alt="" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc288852cfb9.png 720w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_5dc288852cfb9-300x208.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5 id="save-editor-when-project-explorer-has-focus"&gt;Save editor when Project Explorer has focus&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can now save the active editor even when the Project Explorer has focus.

Since I started pulling together ways to easily experience this with OpenShift Container Platform, back with &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo" target="_blank"&gt;version 3.3&lt;/a&gt; believe it or not, we've come a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some time now I've been waiting for the local installation that stopped being supported with &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo" target="_blank"&gt;OpenShift Container Platform 3.9&lt;/a&gt; to reappear in version 4.x. Well now it's finally here with the last release of OpenShift Container Platform 4.2, in the form of Code Ready Containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea was to make this as streamlined of an experience as possible by using the same &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo" target="_blank"&gt;OpenShift Container Platform Easy Local Install project&lt;/a&gt;. Let's take a look at what this looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first focus was to have this work for Unix based operating systems using a single installation script. The secondary wish is to provide a windows based installation script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;Linux or Mac installation&lt;/h3&gt;This installation requires the following (all freely available):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre class="code highlight" lang="plaintext"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;"&gt;&lt;span class="line" id="LC1" lang="plaintext"&gt;1. HyperKit for OSX, Hyper-V for Windows, or Libvirt for Linux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line" id="LC2" lang="plaintext"&gt;2. Code Ready Containers (OCP 4.2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line" id="LC3" lang="plaintext"&gt;3. OpenShift Client (oc) v4.2.0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you need to ensure your virtualization tooling is installed for your platform, just search online for how to do that or your specific platform. Second you need to download the Code Ready Containers. Finally, you need the OpenShift client. Normally you'd expect to have to track these last two down but we've made this all easy by just including checks during the installation. If you have something installed, it checks the version, if good then it moves on with next steps. If anything is missing or wrong version, the installation stops and notifies you where to find that component for your platform (including URL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's get started by downloading the &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo/-/archive/master/ocp-install-demo-master.zip" target="_blank"&gt;OpenShift Container Platform Easy Local Install Project and unzipping in some directory&lt;/a&gt;. This gives you a file called &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;ocp-install-demo-master.zip&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;just unzip and run the &lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;"&gt;init.sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; $ ./init.sh &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions as each of the dependencies is checked and you're provided with pointers to getting the versions you need for your platform. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: Each Code Ready Container download is tied to an embedded secret. This secret you need to download (link will be provided) as a file and you'll be asked to point to that secret to start your container platform. This pull-secret has a 30 day lifespan, so once it's expired you'll need to download both a new Code Ready Container AND a new pull-secret. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you've gotten all the dependencies sorted out, the install runs like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zgpBf1bu4sU/XcWIMoyMHyI/AAAAAAAAwsw/J0nom9zPqAY0v4TSeX5NBVu_lHTvCtDlACNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2B2019-11-08%2Bat%2B16.21.38.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="1414" data-original-width="1264" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zgpBf1bu4sU/XcWIMoyMHyI/AAAAAAAAwsw/J0nom9zPqAY0v4TSeX5NBVu_lHTvCtDlACNcBGAsYHQ/s640/Screenshot%2B2019-11-08%2Bat%2B16.21.38.png" width="571" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little ASCII art and then it's checking for my platforms virtualization (Hyperkit), then looking for the OpenShift client version 4.2 (oc client), then running a setup (crc setup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ynR__THDufU/XcWJXHXWBhI/AAAAAAAAws8/qnDZmQkYFgIxSoDe44dcld0Y5cSj4JPWQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2B2019-11-08%2Bat%2B16.27.14.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="670" data-original-width="1200" height="355" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ynR__THDufU/XcWJXHXWBhI/AAAAAAAAws8/qnDZmQkYFgIxSoDe44dcld0Y5cSj4JPWQCNcBGAsYHQ/s640/Screenshot%2B2019-11-08%2Bat%2B16.27.14.png" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next steps are providing the pull-secret-file, you can set this in the variables at the top of the installation script.

The problem is I've not been able to test this yet on a windows machine, so I'd love to call out to the readers out there that might have some time to contribute to test this script and help us complete the installation. You'll notice a few TODO's marked in the scripts code, as they are untested areas in the installation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&amp;amp;issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=" target="_blank"&gt;raise new issues here&lt;/a&gt; and help us complete the windows based installation and get your name added to the contributors list. We'd be really thankful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned for more on cloud native development using other Red Hat technologies on your new OpenShift Container Platform installed locally on your own machine!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/schabell/jboss?a=j2IBGFQ40b4:fS9sXqFCgVE:yIl2AUoC8zA"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/schabell/jboss?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/schabell/jboss?a=j2IBGFQ40b4:fS9sXqFCgVE:63t7Ie-LG7Y"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/schabell/jboss?d=63t7Ie-LG7Y" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/schabell/jboss?a=j2IBGFQ40b4:fS9sXqFCgVE:4cEx4HpKnUU"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/schabell/jboss?i=j2IBGFQ40b4:fS9sXqFCgVE:4cEx4HpKnUU" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/schabell/jboss?a=j2IBGFQ40b4:fS9sXqFCgVE:F7zBnMyn0Lo"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/schabell/jboss?i=j2IBGFQ40b4:fS9sXqFCgVE:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/schabell/jboss?a=j2IBGFQ40b4:fS9sXqFCgVE:V_sGLiPBpWU"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/schabell/jboss?i=j2IBGFQ40b4:fS9sXqFCgVE:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/schabell/jboss?a=j2IBGFQ40b4:fS9sXqFCgVE:qj6IDK7rITs"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/schabell/jboss?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/schabell/jboss?a=j2IBGFQ40b4:fS9sXqFCgVE:gIN9vFwOqvQ"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/schabell/jboss?i=j2IBGFQ40b4:fS9sXqFCgVE:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/schabell/jboss/~4/j2IBGFQ40b4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/jbossbuzz/~4/0pQsTdRojcw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><summary>It's been awhile since I've talked about running OpenShift Container Platform on your local machine.
